            Outfit Recommender System (Final Thesis)
        </h3>
        <p>
            Developing an AI-based recommendation system designed to identify a user’s clothing style and suggest personalized outfits accordingly. The project focuses on understanding user preferences through data-driven representations rather than visual processing, leveraging modern recommender system techniques.        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of relying on computer vision, the system learns dense feature vector representations of clothing items from textual and categorical information such as product descriptions, colors, and style tags. These embeddings capture semantic relationships between items, allowing the model to recognize similarities in fashion aesthetics and trends.        </p>
        <p>
            Based on these learned representations, the model generates outfit recommendations that align with the user’s inferred style. The system combines content-based filtering and similarity search to assemble cohesive outfit suggestions, ensuring that items are stylistically consistent and relevant to individual preferences.        </p>
        <p>
            The project aims to explore how representation learning can enhance personalization in the fashion domain. By leveraging dense vector spaces and recommender algorithms, it provides an intelligent, scalable approach to helping users discover clothing that matches their unique tastes and identities.        </p>

            Aigües de Barcelona Data Challenge
        </h3>
        <p>
            Our team participated as finalists in the Aigües de Barcelona Data Challenge, where we tackled the issue of increasing water demand caused by mass tourism in Barcelona, focusing particularly on its impact on the commercial sector. With over 8.2 million tourists visiting the city in 2023 compared to just 1.6 million residents, the project aimed to quantify and predict the effect of tourism on daily water consumption.
        </p>
        <p>Using data provided by AGBAR, we developed a machine learning model to forecast water demand based on historical consumption, meteorological variables, population distribution, and tourism data. By integrating these sources, the model identified patterns linking climatic and touristic fluctuations to variations in water use, offering insights for more efficient and sustainable water management. The project also explored scenario simulations to anticipate future demand peaks, reinforcing Barcelona’s long-term resilience in managing critical urban resources.</p>

            Runner-up for Technical Excellence at the Hertie Berlin Hackathon. Built a predictive model to identify high-risk road areas in Berlin by analyzing weather,
            time, and traffic data, generating an interactive heatmap to improve road safety and urban planning. 
            The model leveraged advanced feature engineering and spatial analysis techniques to uncover correlations 
            between environmental conditions and accident likelihood. This project demonstrated how data-driven insights 
            can support smarter urban mobility decisions and contribute to safer, more sustainable cities.

            Aina Hack
        </h3>
        <p>
            Created a Catalan-speaking virtual assistant for universities during the AinaHack hackathon, organized by CTTI. 
            The chatbot, powered by Salamandra and Llama 3 models, automates responses to students’ academic queries, 
            improving accessibility and efficiency in university administration. To enhance the accuracy and relevance of responses, 
            we implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that retrieves context-specific information from university documentation before generating an answer. 
            This approach allowed the assistant to deliver precise, natural, and context-aware responses to complex student questions. 
            The project showcased how AI and language models can strengthen digital services in Catalan and streamline communication between students and institutions.
